Install and configure git..

git config --global user.name "avinash"
git config --global user.email "avinash@gmail.com"
git config --list
git config --global --edit
git config --global core.editor "vim"

git init						--> onetime.. 
git add	.						--> Git will track the files and changes
git commit -m "commit msg"		--> Code/files commits to local directory

git status						--> To know/identify the current status

git log							--> To get commit hostory with info
git log --oneline				--> simoplified commit history
git log --oneline --author="root"	--> To get specific user commits
git show "commit-id"			--> displays the specif commit details


===========

Configure .gitignore

Our local repo dont have remote repo information.. We have to add it.. 

git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/avizway1/awar06-git-code.git
git push -u origin main

------
create a new repository on the command line
------

mkdir awar06-git-code
echo "# awar06-git-code" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/avizway1/awar06-git-code.git
git push -u origin main


=======

push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/avizway1/awar06-git-code.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

---

git remote -v				--> We can identify the remote origin configured in your local repo

git remote show origin		--> Show detailed remote repo configuration info

---

git fetch					--> fetches the latest inforamtion/metadata to local repo

git pull					--> updates your local repo with code changes

---

Branching : 

git branch					--> Shows the git branches

git branch feature-x		--> creates a branch with name feature-x

git checkout feature-x		--> Switches to feature-x branch - traditional
git switch feature-x		--> Switches to feature-x branch - modern

git checkout -b feature-y	--> Creates a new branch and checout/switch to it

main --> 2 files --> Switched to Feature-x created 3 files --> ls (main + f-x) = 5 files

touch feature-x{1..3}.txt
git add .
git commit -m "added feature-x code"

--> switch to main as we want to merge feature-x to the main repo

git switch main

git merge feature-x				--> now feature-x code added to main branch

git push -u origin feature-x		--> To push a specific branch to remote repo

===========

step 1 : create a repo and add a file info.txt

hello
My Name is ABC
Working as XYZ

--

Step 2 ; Clone the repo into ec2 instance

git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-url>
git checkout -b branch1

vim info.txt

hello
My Name is Avinash
Working as AWS Engineer

git add info.txt
git commit -m "added avinash info"

** DO NOT PUSH or MERGE

==========

Step 3: Switch your laptop

Git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo>

edit info.txt

hello
My Name is Anudeep
Working as Digital marketing Executive

git add info.txt
git commit -m "added anudeep info"
git push origin main

============

Step 4 : Switch back to ec2 instance

git switch main
git pull origin main

--

git merge branch1

======

edit the file and resolve the conflict then commit and push it to repo

Hello
<<<<<<< HEAD
My Name is Anudeep
AM working as Digital marketing Executive
=======
My Name is Avinash
AM working as AWS Architect
>>>>>>> branch1

================================

Rebase : Pick my work and place on top of the latest work.. 

Git Temp removes your commit
Moves your branch to the latest main commit
re-applies our commit on top it.

--> Merge : Combines the paths with a merge commit
--> Rebase : replays our work on top of existing latest work

--------------


HEAD --> Where am right now.. HEAD always points to the current commit you are working on. 

--

GIT Restore : undo the file changes, Not commits..

Whatever the file edit you have without commits, it will undo

---

GIT Reset : move HEAD backward.. This erase commits and go back

THis reqrites the history

---

Stash : Saves our unfinished work and clean my workspace for further work.. (Hides our changes temp)

--> Working on a full feature, Your code is not ready commit, 
but you need to switch to a brqnch and do some other work to fix an issue/bug.


git stash			--> Save changes temporarily
git stash list		--> Shows all stashed changes
git stash apply []	--> Brings back the changes
git stash pop []	--> apply the change and then removes 
git stash drop		--> delete the stash
git stash clear		--> delete all stashes

----

git cherry-pick : We cna use this to pick one particular commit..

Git cherry pick helps us to selectively copy a single commit from one branch to another b ranch without merging everything.

--

diff :  With the help of diff, we can see what changed.

--

fork : From an existing repo, we can take a copy of it to our account and we can do our own changes based on our requirement.

If you want to send these changes to the main/base repo, you can create a pull request, the main repo owner has to accept the changes.
