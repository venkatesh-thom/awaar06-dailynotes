/dev (Device files) : Contains files that represents hardqre devices (Hard disks).. 

/etc (Configuration files) : Stores system wide configurqtions.. (user pwd: /etc/passwd). System settings and service management related..

/usr (user programs) : similar to "c:\program Files".. Contains installed programs and libraries..

/sbin (system binaries) : system admin commands.. Only root user or super user can execute these comamnds..

/var (Variable files) : Contains data that changes frequently.. (logs, messages)

/mnt (mount points) ; Temp mount point for system
/media (removable media) : usb, cd..
/lib and /lib64 : Library files.. : similar to windows .dll files..
/opt : optional or 3rd party software
/tmp : temporary directory

adduser avinash
    2  adduser anudeep

usermod -aG devteam avinash 
usermod -aG devteam anudeep 
usermod -aG managers aravind 

sudo -u anudeep mkdir /home/anudeep/private

now try to access/list anything from anudeep's private directory as any other user.. It should not work

====

cd /opt
mkdir devprojects
chgrp devteam /opt/devprojects
chmod 775 /opt/devprojects

--> We tried to create files as devteam members (avinash and anudeep), worked
--> We tried to create files as managers team members (aravind), not worked

===

cd /tmp
mkdir temp_team
chmod 1777 /tmp/temp_team			--> This enables the sticky bit

now, switch to avinash user and create file "touch avinash.txt" and write some info
change file permisisons to everyone "chmod 777 avinash.txt"

Then, switch to anudeep user and try to access the file and try to add info using "echo", should work.. delete should not work

updatedb						--> locate updates its db
locate <filename>
locate <dir-name>

tee command works better with sudo

ls -l | tee output.txt				--> Output displays in terminal and stores the info in output.txt
echo "test data" | sudo tee /etc/test.conf
ls | file1.txt file2.txt			--> end output to multiple files
ping google.com | tee ping.log

sed --> Stream Editor : it edits text automatically without opening the file.


echo "i like banana"									--> output: i like banana 

echo "i like banana" | sed 's/banana/mango/'			--> output: i like mango

sed 's/s3/cloudwatch' aws.txt			--> This displays the output with changes but dont edit the file

sed -i 's/s3/cloudwatch' aws.txt		--> changes text inside the file also

sed -i 's/s3/cloudwatch/g' aws.txt		--> add parameter to change all the occurances 

sed '/cloudwatch/d' 					--> Deletes all lines matches with word

sed -n '1,3p' aws.txt 					--> DSisplays from line 1 to 3
