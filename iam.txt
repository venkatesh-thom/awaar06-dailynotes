ISP : Internet Service Provider : Act, Airtel, jio, Pioneer...
CSP : CLoud Service Provider : AWS, Azure, GCP, Rackspace, Alibaba, Fujitsu..

CSP Provide Infra over Internet..

Infrastructure : 


Web Server (nginx+apache) + App Server (App logic) + Database Server (user sensitive info) + Storage Server (SAN/NAS - S3, Blob)

Network + Firewall

--> Scaling (Adding more resources or more servers)

Vertical Scaling : Adding More resources to the same server/db
Horizontal Scaling : Adding More servers to perform the same job

LoadBalancer : Distributes the traffic across the healthy resources..

--> Server IP / Load Balancer IP ==> DNS ==> Domain Name map


Pay-as-you-Go : Pay for the resources you actually use... (5 min --> 5 min)
Pay-as-you-Grow : Increase your server capacity based on your work load and 
pay for the capacity you use.. 

======

AWS Global Infrastructure : 

Regions : No technical Defination available for this word called "region".. Its a physical or geographical area, aws segregated entire world into regions.. 38 Regions (as of Nov 2025)
mumbai : ap-south-1
Hyd : ap-south-2

Availability Zones : AZ / Availability Zone is nothing but a Data Center or combination of DCs.. 120 Availability Zones as of Nov 2025.. 
Mumbai : 3 AZs : ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b, ap-south-1c
Hyd : 3 AZs : ap-south-2a, ap-south-2b, ap-south-2c


EDGE Locations : CDN (Content Delivery Network) : Cloudfront : 700+ Point of presence or Edge locations across the globe.. Desined to store the data temporarily, near to end customers geographical location, to deliver the data without latency.. 


Latency : Time to get response from the server.. 


Windows : tracert google.com

Linux : traceroute google.com

===

Enable MFA on your root account for better security.. 


root user : root user will have unrestricted access on our AWS accounts.. He can do anything.. Launch instance, delete database, delete data.. change credit card.. change support plan.. close account..

3 Members working on AWS.. 

1 --> Lead --> All Services Access
2 --> Data Admin --> S3, RDS
3 --> Network Activies --> VPC, Transit Gateway, VPN


IAM User : Identity and Access Management : We can create users.. We can allocate permissions (Policy) based on his job roles.. 


1 --> UN & PWD --> Lead --> All Services Access
2 --> UN & PWD --> Data Admin --> S3, RDS Policy
3 --> UN & PWD --> Network Activies --> VPC, Transit Gateway, VPN Policy

Least Privilages Mechanism : Provide permissions to the user to perform his jub duties or activities.. Dont provide any addl permisisons..!!

Requirement : We are using Storage service extensively, We need a dedicated staorage engineer to manage s3 service.

IAM Users will have 2 types of Accesses
1. AWS Management console access (Username, Password and Sign-In URL) : Browser login
2. Programatic Access (AccessKeyID and SecretAccess Key) : AWS CLI Install --> Command Prompt


Implict Allow : If we provide S3 Access to a user, he can access only s3 service, he cannot access any other service.. Remaining all services access will be debied..


Explicit Deny : 


---

==> How to secure your root account.?
==> What support plan you are using in your current project.?
==> IAM Permisisons


---

Policy : Contains set of permisisons on AWS environment. Writtens in JSON format. 

AWS Managed : AWS provided this based on the service we have. We cannot edit or Delete these policies.

AWS Managed - Job Functon : AWS provided this based on the standard jobs we have. We cannot edit or Delete these policies.
DBA : Database (full), Storage (limited), Server (Read)
Network Admin : VPC (full), Server (Read)

Customer Managed : We can create our own policies, depends on our requirements. We can delete/edit. AWS maintains versions.

---

Requirement : I need a policy to allow user to access "S3 and EC2" with Custom Policy.. 

Service : The AWS service the policy targets (S3, ec2, rds)  				: S3, ec2
Effect : The result of the policy, it can be "Allow" or "Deny"				: Allow
Actions : The operations permitted or denied. (upload, download)			: *
Resources : The specified resources the policy applies to (bucket/server)	: *

---

Requirement 2 : I need an IAM user, He need Full/all services Access (AdministratorAccess), but He should not access S3 as it contains some sensitive info.

Service : The AWS service the policy targets (S3, ec2, rds)  				: *
Effect : The result of the policy, it can be "Allow" or "Deny"				: Allow
Actions : The operations permitted or denied. (upload, download)			: *
Resources : The specified resources the policy applies to (bucket/server)	: *

Service : The AWS service the policy targets (S3, ec2, rds)  				: S3
Effect : The result of the policy, it can be "Allow" or "Deny"				: Deny
Actions : The operations permitted or denied. (upload, download)			: *
Resources : The specified resources the policy applies to (bucket/server)	: *

---

AdministratorAccess = He will full access on all the services we have in AWS. Equailant to root user, but without account management.

--

Conflict : Administrator Access is allowing S3 and Deny-S3 policy is denying S3.. Effect: ???

** You allow 100 times (user, group, resources), but denied 1 time = "Deny" will take effect


--

--> Policy supportsd max of 6,144 Charectors
--> A user can have max 20 managed policies.

Inline Policies : its directly embedded into a single user or group. We cannot reuse these policies.

--> Not reusable
--> Difficult to track

---

Policy Simulator : helps to simulate the user permissions for the given action.., Smal handy tool for IAM permisisons evaluation..
The simulator evaluates the policies that you choose and determines the effective permissions for each of the actions that you specify.

---

How to track IAM user activities.?
Ans : Cloudtrail.. We can track all IAM user activities (inclusing Refresh).. Enabled in every account, by deafult.. Free.. 

**With Cloudtrail, we cannot track ec2/Network traffic.. "VPC FlowLogs"
---

Access Analyser : 

External access findings : Identify resources shared with an external entity (Free)..
Internal access findings : Identify internal IAM users and roles that can access specific resources
Unused access findings : Identify IAM users and roles with unused access

---

Credential report : Helps to get user information (i.e; last loggedin, user created, last password used, Accesskey..) : The credentials report lists all your IAM users in this account and the status of their various credentials. After a report is created, it is stored for up to four hours.

ARN : Amazon Resource Name : THis gives uniqueness to the resources we have in our AWS account.. 

---

Requirement 3 : I need an IAM user, This user required full access on S3 Service, But, He should be able to access s3 only from corporate network.

IAM User : 2 Types of Access.. 

1. Management console Access : Username, Password and SignURL : Browser 
2. AWS CLI (Comamnd Line Interface) Access : AccesskeyID and Secret Access key : Install AWS CLI Tools (Windows/Linux/Mac)

https://aws.amazon.com/cli Download and install cli tools in your laptop

aws --version

aws configure

Accesskey : 
SecretAccesskey : 
Region : ap-south-1
output : json/table/text


aws sts get-caller-identity

aws ec2 describe-instances --region ap-south-2 --output table

aws s3 ls
aws s3 mb

Amazon Q CLI : AI powered Agentic based CLI tool to manage all operations.
--> It uses/interact with Amazon bedrock in backend.


Create an IAM user with username "avinash-test-05112025", attach aws managed "S3FullAccessPolicy", set a temporary password as "temp@12341" and enforce the user to create a new password when login for the first time.


Agent : 
I need an agent to perform below operations..
Purpose: Check AWS resources and generate reports daily basis
Tools: use_aws, fs_write
Generate report : Show AWS integrations, business values and security recommendations
