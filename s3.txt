Storage Classes : 

Durability : 99.999999999% (Chances to loss your data)..
Availability : varies for each storqage class..


S3 Standard : General Purpose storage for "frequently accessed data".. 
You can access data without delays..
Designed for availability : 99.99% 
AZ : >=3 AZ

S3 Standard-IA / Infrequently access :  S3 Stanfdard-IA is for the data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed..
You can access data without delays..
Designed for availability : 99.9% 
AZ : >=3 AZ

S3 OneZone-IA : Recreatable, infrequently accessed data (once a month) with milliseconds access.. 
You can access data without delays..
Designed for availability : 99.5% 
AZ : 1 AZ


Glacier Instant Retrieval : Long-lived archive data accessed once a quarter with instant retrieval in milliseconds..  Designed for availability : 99.9% 
Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Glacier) : Long-lived archive data accessed once a year with retrieval of minutes to hours..Designed for availability : 99.99% 
Glacier Deep Archive : Long-lived archive data accessed less than once a year with retrieval of hours. Designed for availability : 99.99% 

We can't access data immedeatly when required.. We need to initialise the data restoration.. It depends on the storage class we choose.. 

Bulk retrieval : Typically within 5-12 hours.
Standard retrieval : Typically within 3-5 hours.
Expedited retrieval : Typically within 1-5 minutes when retrieving less than 250 MB.

---

Intelligent-Tiering : Data with changing or unknown access patterns: 99.9%

---

versioning : helps to Track changes happening on the file by creating a new versioned object..
helps to restore data to currect state, when any accidental overwrites happens..
Helps to restore the file, if any accidental deletes happens..


delete : Delete marker creates.. Set version to show.. and delete the "delete marker" to get your object back..
permanently delete : gone forever

---

Life Cycle management Rule : 
--> helps to trasit data from storage class to storage class automatically.
--> helps to delete the objects automatically (based on expire / perm delete)
