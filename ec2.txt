EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud : 

Instance --> Server


On-Demand Instances : Unpredictable Workloads.. SHort term testing.. 
--> Charged based on actual usage (pay-as-you-go)
--> More suitable to test our workload, if our workload has unpredictable access patterns..
--> Workload that required flexibility to scale (upgrade/downgrade) the resources


SDLC : Software Development Life Cycle :

Training/Sandbix account : POC : Proof of concept  	--> Small
Dev : Development									--> low conf
QA : Testing										--> low
UAT : Similar to Prod env							--> High conf
PRD : Production / live								--> V High conf (1L Cu) --> 2L

Spot Instances : For flexible workloads with "NO CRITICAL DATA"
--> We have to bid our price against AWS pricing.
--> if our quoted price is equal to AWS spot price or higher than AWS spot price, AWS allocate the instance.
--> Due to demand, if spot price increased than your quoted, AWS Terminate the resources with just 2 min interruption warning.
--> We dont use this for unrecoverable or imporabnt workloads.
--> To test vey high configs at low price.
