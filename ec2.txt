Server = Computer designed to process requests, store data and provide services/resources.

Desktop / Laptop = Designed for day to day activities.. 
Server = Designed to run always.. 

CPU

File/Storage Servers

--> What are the components required to deliver a website to outside world. (instagram)


Code (api)						--> CICD to automate
Load balancer					--> ELB
Server --> OS License			--> EC2
Database --> Db license			--> RDS / DynamoDB
Storage							--> S3
Network (Firewall / switches)	--> VPC
Security (Physical / SSL/TLS)	--> CM
Domain name						--> Route53

EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud : 

Instance --> Server


On-Demand Instances : Unpredictable Workloads.. SHort term testing.. 
--> Charged based on actual usage (pay-as-you-go) - PAYG
--> More suitable to test our workload, if our workload has unpredictable access patterns..
--> Workload that required flexibility to scale (upgrade/downgrade) the resources


SDLC : Software Development Life Cycle :

Training/Sandbix account : POC : Proof of concept  	--> Small
Dev : Development									--> low conf
QA : Testing										--> low
UAT : Similar to Prod env							--> High conf
PRD : Production / live								--> V High conf (1L Cu) --> 2L

---

B2B ==> Business to Business

---

Reserved Instances / RI : More suitable for prediuctable worklaods.. 
--> We go to a reservation with AWS for 1 yr - 3 Yrs..
--> We get this instances at low price, compared to on-demand

Standard : No config changes allowed during the reservation period.
Convertible : Config can be changed (instance family / OS Family).

Payment option:
Full Upfront : Pay all the money first and purchase your config. No monthly charges..
Partial Upfront : Pay 40-70% now, AWS will reduce the hourly price.. Based on your usage, at reduced price, you get charged..
No Upfront : No need to pay anything now, but have to pay monthly basis, based on usage..

--> We can register as seller and sell our unused reserved ec2 instance hours via AWS Marketplace

===

Spot Instances : For flexible workloads with "NO CRITICAL DATA"
--> We have to bid our price against AWS pricing.
--> if our quoted price is equal to AWS spot price or higher than AWS spot price, AWS allocate the instance.
--> Due to demand, if spot price increased than your quoted, AWS Terminate the resources with just 2 min interruption warning.
--> We dont use this for unrecoverable or imporabnt workloads.
--> To test vey high configs at low price.

You Bid for an ec2 instance and you go the ec2 instance (Bid price : 0.50$).. You used this instance for 2 hours 45 minutes..

--> Price Increased by AWS and Instance terminated... We will get charged for full hours .. No cost for partial hours.. (2 Hrs)
--> No changes in Price, You done with your worload and you Instance terminated... We will get charged for total duration.. (2 hrs 45 min)

OS : AMI (Amazon Machine Image) : linux, Windows
CPU / Processor & RAM /Memory : These 2 coponents comes as a bundle (Instance Type)
Storage / Hard Disk : EBS (Elasic Block Storage) : SSD, HDD and Magnetic
Network :  NIC/ ENI (Elastic network Interface) : 
Firewall - Security Group (windows - RDP (3389), Linux - ssh(22))


Step 1 : Add tags 

Name : My-Windows-demo
Project : WTC-project
Client : C1
Platform : Windows
CostCenter : AAZAA

Step 2 : Choose an AMI (Amazon machine Image) : Choose OS

AMI : pre-configured template of an Operating System provided by AWS. We no need to install OS on H/W. AWS runs the selected AMI on selected Instance type.


Step 3 : Choose an Instance Type

General purposes : Balanced compute, memory and networking.. small and mid sized DB / Web apps.. (T, M)
Compute optimised : for CPU intensive workload/tasks.. HPC, Batch Processing.. C4, C5, C6
Memory optimised : memory intensive app.. DB, Distributed in memory workload.. r4, r5, x1, z1
Storage Optimised : Better IOPS.. Distributed DB, graph DB.. i4, i3, d
GPU Optimised : Graphic units.. Machiene learning, gaming, AI.. f1, p3, g

m5.large
c6.xlarge

General purpose: M1 | M2 | M3 | M4 | T1 | T2
Compute optimized: C1 | C3 | C4
Memory optimized: R3 | R4 | X1 | X1e
Storage optimized: D2 | H1 | I2 | I3
Accelerated computing: F1 | G3 | P2 | P3

Step 4 : Choose Keypair

Public Key : Stores in AWS, AWS COpies inside ec2 instance (lock)
Private Key : (.pem) : Download and store in our laptop. 

Both the keys required to connect to ec2 instance. Designed for secure authentication with encryption.

Step 5 : Choose network Settings


Step 5 : Choose network settings

--> Make sure to open required port based on your OS
Windows --> 3389 --> RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) --> Anywhere/Custom/myIP
Linux --> 22 --> SSH (Secure Shell) --> Anywhere/Custom/myIP

RDP --> Anywhere

Step 6 : Choose Storage

Go with the default storage for now.
Root Volume --> A Volume that contains OS of our Instance.

====


MacOS : Navigate to AppStore --> Search "Windows App", Install it

Windows : No addl software required..
All windows laptops defaultly have "RDP tool"
Open RUN (win + R) --> Type "mstsc" --> Click on enter
Now, RDP tool opens --> Enter "pubic Ip" at Computer name field.
Browse keypair and get the username and password, then enter that cred.. 


Public IP : unique across the globe : 
Private IP : unique within the network, Wont work outside of your network..

1. Terminate : Delete : you dont need this instane and its data anymore..
2. STOP : We have an option to start the instance again.. We dont loss any data..
